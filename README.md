## Introduction

Predicting stock market trends is a challenging task, and it involves the analysis of complex financial data. The ARIMA model, a popular time series analysis method, takes into account past data points and trends to predict future market movements. In this project, we leverage the power of Python to build and evaluate an ARIMA model for stock market prediction.

## Methodology

The methodology used in this project can be summarized as follows:

1. **Data Collection:** Obtain historical stock market data from reliable sources. For this project, we used Yahoo finance.

2. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values, outliers, and ensure the data is in a suitable format for analysis.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Perform EDA to gain insights into the data, identify patterns, and understand key statistical properties.

4. **ARIMA Model Building:** Utilize the Python libraries to implement the ARIMA model. We tune the model parameters and identify the optimal values using techniques such as AIC (Akaike Information Criterion) and BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion).

5. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the ARIMA model's performance using various metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

6. **Prediction:** Make stock market predictions using the trained ARIMA model and visualize the results.

## Installation

1. Install the required libraries:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
